## Introduction
This guide covers tools that every student should know about.
Each section is written by a different team member.

## VS Code

**Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) is a free code editor made by Microsoft.
It is one of the most popular editors for programming.
- VS Code is designed to streamline the *edit-build-debug* cycle for developers.

### Key Uses and Operations
- **Code Editing**: Supports hundreds of languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.) with features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and bracket matching.
- **IntelliSense**: Provides smart code completion, suggesting variables, methods, and modules as you type based on the context of your project.
- **Debugging**: Includes a built-in debugger that allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code line-by-line to find errors.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Features a built-in command line (supporting Bash, PowerShell, etc.), allowing you to run scripts and tools without leaving the editor.
- **Version Control**: Has native integration with Git, enabling you to track changes, commit code, and manage repositories directly.
- **Extensions Marketplace**: Offers over 60,000 plugins to add support for new languages, themes, and specialized tools like Live Server or ~~Prettier~~

### Why is it useful for students
- VS Code is widely recommended for students because it balances professional-grade power with beginner-friendly accessibility
1. **Free and Cross-Platform**: It is completely free and works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring students can use it regardless of their hardware.
2. **Resource Efficient**: Unlike full-featured IDEs (like Visual Studio or IntelliJ), VS Code is lightweight and runs smoothly even on older laptops or computers with limited RAM.
3. **Career Preparation**: Students learn on the same tool used by over 75% of professional developers, making their skills directly transferable to the workplace.
4. **Visual Learning**: Features like syntax highlighting and error warnings (red underlines) help beginners spot and understand mistakes more easily.
5. **Collaboration Tools**: The Live Share extension allows students to pair-program and edit code together in real-time, which is ideal for group projects or remote tutoring.
6. **Online Education Platform**: Microsoft offers VS Code for Education, a zero-setup, web-based version with built-in curriculum for learning Python and Web Development.
