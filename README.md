## Introduction
This guide covers tools that every student should know about.
Each section is written by a different team member.

## VS Code

**Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) is a free code editor made by Microsoft.
It is one of the most popular editors for programming.
- VS Code is designed to streamline the *edit-build-debug* cycle for developers.
[visual studio code](https://vscode.dev/)

### Key Uses and Operations
- **Code Editing**: Supports hundreds of languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.) with features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and bracket matching.
- **IntelliSense**: Provides smart code completion, suggesting variables, methods, and modules as you type based on the context of your project.
- **Debugging**: Includes a built-in debugger that allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code line-by-line to find errors.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Features a built-in command line (supporting Bash, PowerShell, etc.), allowing you to run scripts and tools without leaving the editor.
- **Version Control**: Has native integration with Git, enabling you to track changes, commit code, and manage repositories directly.
- **Extensions Marketplace**: Offers over 60,000 plugins to add support for new languages, themes, and specialized tools like Live Server or ~~Prettier~~
- **Built-in Version Control (Git)**: It offers seamless integration with Git and other version control systems, allowing users to manage repositories, track changes, resolve merge conflicts, and commit code without leaving the editor.

### Why is it useful for students
- VS Code is widely recommended for students because it balances professional-grade power with beginner-friendly accessibility
1. **Free and Cross-Platform**: It is completely free and works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring students can use it regardless of their hardware.
2. **Resource Efficient**: Unlike full-featured IDEs (like Visual Studio or IntelliJ), VS Code is lightweight and runs smoothly even on older laptops or computers with limited RAM.
3. **Career Preparation**: Students learn on the same tool used by over 75% of professional developers, making their skills directly transferable to the workplace.
4. **Visual Learning**: Features like syntax highlighting and error warnings (red underlines) help beginners spot and understand mistakes more easily.
5. **Collaboration Tools**: The Live Share extension allows students to pair-program and edit code together in real-time, which is ideal for group projects or remote tutoring.
6. **Online Education Platform**: Microsoft offers VS Code for Education, a zero-setup, web-based version with built-in curriculum for learning Python and Web Development.

### New updates on VS code
- Unified Agent Experience: VS Code is now designed as a single interface for orchestrating various local, cloud, and background agents.
- Message Steering and Queuing: You can send follow-up messages while a current AI request is running, choosing to add it to a queue, steer the agent's current task, or stop the current task immediately.
- *Agent Skills as Slash Commands*: AI agent skills can be invoked on demand directly from the chat input using slash commands (e.g., /webapp-testing), making specialized workflows more accessible.
- *Agent Hooks*: Allows users to run custom shell commands at key agent lifecycle points, such as before a tool is used, to enforce policies or automate checks.
- *Mermaid Diagrams in Chat*: Chat responses can now render interactive Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.), allowing models to visually break down complex concepts.
- ********Improved Plan Agent*: The built-in plan agent now uses a structured, four-phase iterative workflow (Discovery, Alignment, Design, Refinement) to produce higher-quality implementation plans.
- *Subagents for Complex Tasks*: Agents can use subagents to break down complex tasks, which operate in their own isolated context windows, preventing main context window limits from being reached and allowing parallel execution.
- *Auto Model Selection*: VS Code can automatically select the optimal language model (including GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, etc.) to ensure optimal performance and reduce rate limits for GitHub Copilot users.
- *Model Agnostic Tools*: Tools and the underlying architecture are increasingly model-agnostic, allowing integration with third-party models and the ability to bring your own API keys (BYOK) for various providers.
